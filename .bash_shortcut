It involves quickly verifying "exceptional" or "invalid" conditions and immediately returning a result or exiting the function, thus avoiding deep nesting of conditional blocks (like "if-else"). This makes the code more readable and maintainable, as edge cases are handled upfront, leaving the main logic flow clear and straightforward."
